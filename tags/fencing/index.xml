      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started fencing epee competitively in the Spring of 2012 at LAIFC, where I was very fortunate to train with some of the best fencers and coaches in the world.
Through many intense practices and about forty tournaments, I progressed very quickly.
The U.S. Fencing Association uses a rating system where beginners are unrated and more experienced fencers are rated from E to A, where A is the highest rating.
Within a year of training, I earned an E and a C.
A year later, I earned a B at a tournament at my club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up not fencing during my senior year of high school because of school and other obligations taking up my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got to Michigan, I decided I had to start fencing again.
Fortunately for me, the University of Michigan Fencing Club is one of the top college clubs in the country, so I can practice regularly and compete at a high level.
Because of this, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to maintain much of my skill and perhaps even improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I competed at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://askfred.net/Results/results.php?tournament_id=30100&#34;&gt;Todd Curn Memorial tournament&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Royal Arts Fencing Academy in Columbus, OH; won the gold medal; and finally earned my &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; after coming so close so many times! Below is a playlist of YouTube videos with my final three elimination bouts (starting with the best bout&amp;ndash;the semifinal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X6ZHHLDck30?list=PLwfXW8DKOrg1cLm2BXwatRqPhEH5_jcGH&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last two bouts were against &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo;s and were generally regarded as some of the best fencers in the area.
In particular, my semifinal bout was one of the hardest fights I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had.
I was at one point down 9-13 (these bouts go to 15) and had to outscore my opponent 6-1 to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The win was easily one of the most gratifying experiences in my life&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the other side enough times that finally being on the winning side felt beyond amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve now achieved my long-standing goal of earning an &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo;, I can focus on crushing our little brothers at MSU in school tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
