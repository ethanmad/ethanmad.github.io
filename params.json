{"name":"ethanmad.github.io","tagline":"Website for HyperTyper","body":"### Ready to #HyperType?\r\nHyperTyper is the easiest way to instantly improve your typing abilities. Whether you're looking to improve your average score on a typing competition website, dominate your opponents in a typing race, or get the top spot on a speed typing website, HyperTyper is the utility you need.\r\n\r\nTo prepare your computer, please run the following in a *nix terminal\r\n```\r\n$ yes '#HyperType'\r\n$ yes HyperTyper\r\n$ sudo su HyperTypeMe\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust kidding. HyperTypeMe isn't a command... yet. And those yeses just print out '#HyperType' and 'HyperTyper'. Crtl + C to end those.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nIf you're on Chrome, get the ![HyperTyper on the Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/images/ChromeWebStore_Badge_v2_206x58.png) [HyperTyper Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypertyper/emlnlmijjaghanenmpdjdckanpdinpgn).\r\nOtherwise, add a bookmarklet from [script.js](https://github.com/ethanmad/HyperTyper/blob/master/script.js).\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
